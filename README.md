# fabric-contract-workflow
An example of how to build Smart Contracts in GitHub Actions

- Smart Contract is a copy of the one used in the full stack application sample
- It's built in GithubActions and pushed to the github repository

Each organization's Fabric Deployment Workflow would then pull in new versions of this packaged Smart Contract to run as needed
